I used to be a Software Engineer, with a focus on performance and memory usage for deep learning models in production. Now, I'm passionate about low-level programming (yes I **love** C), infosec and open source. I also love Cats, the French "Nouvelle Vague" and 70s electronic music.

### My work ðŸ›€
Although most of my work used to be done under my professional account [matthiasmindee](https://github.com/matthiasmindee), while my current projects are on this account.

- I'm writing my own kernel in C from scratch mainly with the help of [os-dev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page), which I hope to showcase soon enough.
- While doing so, I wrote a tool to auto-generate C headers [cprotogen](https://github.com/Mattcrmx/cprotogen).
- I actually wrote one for Cython as well [cyheadgen](https://github.com/Mattcrmx/cyheadgen).
- I wrote a tool detecting file descriptor leaks in C with Python bindings for use as a library [fd-watcher](https://github.com/Mattcrmx/fd-watcher).
- I'm a maintainer of [tawazi](https://github.com/mindee/tawazi), a DAG scheduler library written in pure python also acting as a framework for building applications leveraging directed acyclic graphs.
- I learned a bit of Rust with [brother](https://github.com/Mattcrmx/brother), a toy html renderer written in Rust, and a bit of Haskell with another project.
